# AGENTS.md — tt

`tt` ("tmux team") is a single-file bash tool: per-project tmux session +
a pool of `pi` code workers. This file orients an AI agent working **on**
`tt` itself.

## Read first

1. `docs/STATUS.md` — current state, what is tested, what is not.
   **Always read before editing.**
2. `docs/DESIGN.md` — design and rationale (the live-REPL model and the
   `tt-worker` extension control channel).
3. `README.md` — user-facing usage and command reference.

## Layout

- `tt` — the tool itself. Pure bash, `set -euo pipefail`.
- `tt-worker.ts` — the pi extension `tt` drives the REPLs through.
  Installed globally via `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` (`extensions`).
- `~/.local/bin/tt` is a **symlink** to `./tt` — edits here take effect
  immediately, no install step.
- `docs/` — design, status, handoff.

## Conventions & invariants — do not regress

- **`set-option` targets use the bare-name `"$s:"` form**, not `"=$s"`.
  The `=` exact-match prefix is rejected by `set-option`.
- **Never `tmux attach` when `$TMUX` is set** — use `switch-client` via
  `enter_session()`.
- **Pi windows host a live interactive pi REPL**, not a shell. `tt`
  drives them via the `tt-worker` extension's trigger/result files —
  never by `capture-pane` scraping (the retired watermark model was the
  source of every hard bug). See DESIGN.
- **REPL liveness is detected with `pgrep -f` on the worker's
  `--session-dir`**, never `pane_current_command` — pi is a grandchild
  process and tmux reports the foreground command inconsistently.
- **`tt-worker.ts` must stay inert unless `TT_WORKER_CS` is set** — it
  is installed globally, so it loads into every pi session.
- **The `delegating-to-pi` skill must stay excluded from pi workers at
  both levels** — `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` (global-discovered copies)
  *and* `.pi/settings.json` (this repo's `.agents/skills/` copy). pi
  scopes skill `!`-excludes to the discovery location, so one level is
  not enough. A worker is the delegate, never the orchestrator.
- `alfa`/`bravo`/`charlie` are immortal; hard cap of 5 pi workers.

## Testing

There is no test harness — verification is manual against a throwaway
`/tmp/tt-test-*` project. The procedure is in `docs/STATUS.md`. Live
`pi` steps spend OpenAI Codex quota — keep test tasks trivial. After
syntax changes always run `bash -n tt`.

## Consumers

`bassaudio-storefront` is the first adopter:
`.agents/skills/delegating-to-pi/SKILL.md` and its `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`
tell the orchestrator to delegate via `tt pi send` / `tt pi wait`. If you
change the `tt pi` interface, update that skill too.

## Commit etiquette

Commit only when the user asks. Keep `tt` a single file.
