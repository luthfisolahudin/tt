# AGENTS.md — tt

`tt` ("tmux team") is a single-file bash tool: per-project tmux session +
a pool of `pi` code workers. This file orients an AI agent working **on**
`tt` itself.

## Read first

1. `docs/STATUS.md` — current state, what is tested, what is not.
   **Always read before editing.**
2. `docs/DESIGN.md` — design and rationale (the live-REPL model and the
   `tt-worker` extension control channel).
3. `README.md` — user-facing usage and command reference.

## Layout

- `tt` — the tool itself. Pure bash, `set -euo pipefail`.
- `pi-worker/` — worker-only pi runtime templates. `extensions/tt-worker.ts`
  is the pi extension `tt` drives the REPLs through, auto-loaded by pi from
  tt's private `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`.
- `~/.local/bin/tt` is a **symlink** to `./tt` — edits here take effect
  immediately, no install step.
- `docs/` — design, status, handoff.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — version history (newest first).

## Conventions & invariants — do not regress

- **`set-option` targets use the bare-name `"$s:"` form**, not `"=$s"`.
  The `=` exact-match prefix is rejected by `set-option`.
- **Never `tmux attach` when `$TMUX` is set** — use `switch-client` via
  `enter_session()`.
- **Pi windows host a live interactive pi REPL**, not a shell. `tt`
  drives them via the `tt-worker` extension's trigger/result files —
  never by `capture-pane` scraping (the retired watermark model was the
  source of every hard bug). See DESIGN.
- **REPL liveness is detected with `pgrep -f` on the worker's
  `--session-dir`**, never `pane_current_command` — pi is a grandchild
  process and tmux reports the foreground command inconsistently.
- **`pi-worker/extensions/tt-worker.ts` must stay inert unless `TT_WORKER_CS` is set** — this
  is a safety belt even though workers now use a private pi worker dir.
- **The `delegating-to-pi` skill must stay excluded from pi workers** —
  `pi-worker/settings.json` excludes it, and `tt` launches worker REPLs
  with `--no-skills` so project/user-discovered skills cannot make a
  delegate become the orchestrator.
- The pool is **lazy**: `tt up` pre-spawns no workers; a REPL is created on the
  first `tt pi send`/`auto`. No immortal caste — every NATO callsign
  (`alfa`…`zulu`) is ordinary and removable. Hard worker cap `min(cores-2, 26)`
  (`pi_cap`), enforced on every spawn path.
- **Command synopsis style** (help block + README table): flags before
  positionals, source last — `tt <verb> [FLAGS] <positionals> (FILE|-)`; and
  list the short/primary alias first (`ls`/`list`, `rm`/`remove`). Parsers
  accept flags in any position, so synopsis order is documentation only.

## Testing

There is no test harness — verification is manual against a throwaway
`/tmp/tt-test-*` project. The procedure is in `docs/STATUS.md`. Live
`pi` steps spend OpenAI Codex quota — keep test tasks trivial. After
syntax changes always run `bash -n tt`.

## Consumers

Consumer projects reference `tt` via a `delegating-to-pi` skill
(`SKILL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) that tells the orchestrator to
delegate via `tt pi send` / `tt pi wait`. If you change the `tt pi`
interface, update that skill too.

## AI quick reference

```sh
tt pi send alfa - <<'P'
TASK: ...
FILES: path/to/file
CHANGE: ...
SUCCESS: ...
P
                               # dispatch; prints task-id like "alfa-3"
                               # (queues behind a busy worker; lazy-spawns absent)
tt pi wait alfa                # block on alfa's latest task (task-id optional)
TID=$(tt pi auto - <<<'...')   # let tt pick a worker (idle→spawn→pool); echoes "using pi-X"
TID=$(tt pi auto --rm - <<<'...')  # fresh ephemeral worker, reaped after
tt pi send --notify alfa - <<<'...'  # fire-and-forget; pings orchestrator on done
tt pi wait "$TID"              # waits on alfa-3 or pool-3 alike
tt pi steer alfa - <<<'...'    # inject NOW into the current turn (run-now)
tt pi wait all                 # fan-out join across all busy workers
tt pi status                   # show all workers: state, last task, tier, gen
tt pi clear alfa               # wipe context; required before reuse
bash -n tt                     # syntax-check after editing tt
```

Inline prompts use `-` (stdin) with a heredoc/here-string — `tt pi send alfa -
<<<'TASK: ...'` — not process substitution.

Worker states: `idle` · `busy` · `blocked` · `interrupted` · `starting` · `down` · `missing`

## Commit etiquette

Commit only when the user asks. Keep `tt` a single file.

## Versioning

`tt` carries `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` in the `VERSION=` constant at the top of `tt`
(pre-1.0, so MAJOR stays `0`). Bump once per coherent change set — a feature
plus its follow-up fixes/docs share one version, not one bump per commit.

- **PATCH** (`0.3.x`) — the default: a new `tt pi`/`tt x` verb or flag, a
  behavior change, or a bug fix.
- **MINOR** (`0.x.0`) — a cross-cutting shift in the worker model, state layout,
  or runtime (e.g. the live-REPL rewrite, the XDG state move, the worker
  pi-worker split).
- **MAJOR** — reserved for post-1.0.

To bump: edit `VERSION=`, add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry (newest first), commit,
then tag the commit — `git tag -a v<x.y.z> -m "tt v<x.y.z> — <summary>"`. Tags
let you diff releases (`git diff v0.3.9 v0.4.0`). `docs/STATUS.md` tracks only
current state, never history.
